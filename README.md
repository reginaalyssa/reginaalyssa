## My Journey in Tech 💻

I discovered my love for web development during high school when we were introduced to HTML and CSS during our computer class. Ever since then, I decided I wanted to pursue a career in tech.

I started coding using C and Python during my undergraduate (or college) years as part of our curriculum. I also used to love joining hackathons and staying up late. 🧟‍♀️

The first framework I ever tried out was Flask (for [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/)) before moving on to Django and Ruby on Rails.

On the side, I build personal side projects whenever I learn a new language or framework. Feel free to check some of them out: [WriteMe](https://github.com/reginaalyssa/WriteMe) (Django), [Deevo](https://github.com/reginaalyssa/Deevo) (Django for my CS50 final project), [ProfRate](https://github.com/reginaalyssa/ProfRate) (Ruby on Rails), [Business Card w/ Dark Mode](https://github.com/reginaalyssa/ReactJS-Business-Card) (React).

I also occasionally play around with CSS. Here's my attempt on making the Philippine flag 🇵🇭 using a single `div`: [CodePen](https://codepen.io/reginaalyssa01809/pen/eYOMOXG) or [GitHub](https://github.com/reginaalyssa/single-div).

My primary tech stack at the moment include Ruby on Rails and Vue.js, but I'm currently interested in learning Node.js and React.
