## Hello, World! 👋 

My name is Reg. Here are some quick facts about me:

💄 I'm a Full Stack Developer at [BeautyMnl](http://beautymnl.com/)

👩‍🎓 I graduated with a degree of B.S. Computer Science from the University of the Philippines Diliman

🍵 I drink tea everyday (and iced coffee on special days)

👩‍💻  I'm currently volunteering as a JavaScript Tech Lead at [Women Who Code Manila](https://www.womenwhocode.com/manila/about) where we hold study groups every month. Watch out for our events at our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Manila/) page!

## My Journey in Tech 💻

I dipped my toes in HTML and CSS during high school and fell in love 😍 with web development. Because of this, I decided to pursue a career in tech.

I started coding using C and Python during my undergraduate (or college) years as part of our curriculum. I also loved joining hackathons and staying up late. 🧟‍♀️

The first framework I ever tried out was Flask (for [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/)), then I moved on to learning Django and Ruby on Rails.

On the side, I build personal side projects whenever I learn a new language or framework. Check some of them out: [WriteMe](https://github.com/reginaalyssa/WriteMe) (Django), [Deevo](https://github.com/reginaalyssa/Deevo) (Django for my CS50 final project), [ProfRate](https://github.com/reginaalyssa/ProfRate) (Ruby on Rails), [Business Card w/ Dark Mode](https://github.com/reginaalyssa/ReactJS-Business-Card) (React).

I also occasionally play around with CSS. Check out my attempt on making the Philippine flag 🇵🇭 using a single div via [CodePen](https://codepen.io/reginaalyssa01809/pen/eYOMOXG) or [GitHub](https://github.com/reginaalyssa/single-div).

My primary tech stack would be Ruby on Rails and Vue.js, but I'm currently interested in learning Node.js and React.

## Say hi?

I would love to meet fellow people in tech! You can find me on [Twitter (@regalyssa)](https://twitter.com/regalyssa) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/regina-alyssa-esguerra/). 😊 

I'm also open to doing collabs and work on a passion project. Let me know if you're up for it! ✨
